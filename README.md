# Power BI Superstore Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Power BI Superstore Dashboard** is a professional, end-to-end analytics solution built to transform the Sample Superstore dataset into actionable business insights. The dashboard enables exploration of **Sales, Profit, and % Returned Orders**, incorporating **year-over-year comparisons**, product performance, segment analysis, and regional insights. This project demonstrates expertise in **data transformation, SQL, DAX, star schema modeling, and interactive dashboard design**, delivering a polished solution that supports informed decision-making.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to interactively explore metrics, identify trends, and quickly understand the impact of returns on overall profitability. It integrates best practices in **data modeling, visualization, and storytelling**.

## üöÄ Key Contributions
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** Collected, cleaned, and transformed the Orders, Returns, and Date tables using **Power Query** and **SQL queries**, ensuring reliable and accurate analysis.  
- **Star Schema & Relational Modeling:** Built a **central fact table (Orders)** connected to Returns and Date dimension tables, enabling time-based and relational calculations across multiple metrics.  
- **KPI & DAX Development:** Engineered DAX measures for **Sales, Profit, % Returned Orders, YoY growth, and % change vs previous year**, stored in a dedicated Key Measures table for clarity and maintainability.  
- **Interactive Visuals & Dashboard Design:** Created **KPI cards, line charts, bar charts, donut charts, and shape maps** with slicers, bookmarks, and conditional formatting for dynamic exploration.  
- **Problem-Solving & Analysis:** Independently identified trends in product performance, segment profitability, and regional sales to provide actionable insights.

## üåê Data Sources
The project uses the **Sample Superstore dataset**, structured into three main tables:

1. **Orders Table:** Transactional information including order dates, products, quantities, sales, and profits.  
2. **Returns Table:** Tracks returned orders to calculate return rates and profitability impact.  
3. **Date Table:** Supports **time intelligence** in DAX for accurate YoY comparisons.

All datasets are included in `Dataset/Dataset.xls` for reproducibility.

## üî¢ Key Formulas & Logic
- **DAX Measures:** Used for **Sales, Profit, % Returned Orders, YoY growth, and percentage change** calculations.  
- **SQL Queries:** Extracted and aggregated Orders and Returns data to calculate metrics and validate dashboards (`SQL Queries/Store_Queries.sql`).  
- **Star Schema:** Optimized reporting performance and ensured accurate aggregation across multiple dimensions (Product, Segment, Region, Date).  
- **Conditional Formatting & Bookmarks:** Highlight trends, positive/negative changes, and guide users through interactive storytelling.  

Key formulas include:  
- `SUM()`, `SUMX()` ‚Äì Aggregate sales, profit, and returns  
- `DIVIDE()` ‚Äì Calculate percentages and ratios safely  
- `CALCULATE()` ‚Äì Contextual metric calculation with filters  
- `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()` ‚Äì Time intelligence for YoY comparisons  
- `IF()` & `IFERROR()` ‚Äì Conditional logic and error handling
